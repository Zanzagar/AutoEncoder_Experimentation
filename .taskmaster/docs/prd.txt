# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# AutoEncoder Experimentation Framework Migration

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
The AutoEncoder Experimentation Framework is a research tool designed to investigate how autoencoder neural networks represent different types of images and geometric features in latent space. The primary research goal is to understand latent space discrimination capabilities, determine when the latent space breaks down, and identify the minimum set of latent features needed to discriminate between different classes of images.

### 1.2 Current State
- Working implementation exists in `AutoEncoderJupyterTest.ipynb` with 5 sequential code blocks
- Initial experiments with geological datasets completed
- Multiple autoencoder architectures tested with different latent dimensions
- Results stored in `latent_dim_exploration_results_layered_geology/`
- Framework is functional but requires migration to maintainable Python package structure
- **Critical Need**: Proper version control workflow must be established for migration
- **Critical Need**: Proper Jupyter notebook handling using notebook_mcp tools

### 1.3 Business Justification
The current Jupyter notebook approach has become unwieldy for systematic research. Migration to a Python package with proper Git workflow and notebook_mcp tools will:
- Enable reproducible research with consistent visualization
- Support generic datasets and architectures
- Facilitate collaboration and code reuse through version control
- Provide a clean interface for complex experiments
- Enable systematic debugging and testing with change tracking
- Ensure code integrity and backup through Git repository management
- **Prevent notebook corruption** through proper notebook_mcp tool usage

## 2. Product Vision and Goals

### 2.1 Vision Statement

### 2.2 Primary Goals
1. **Migration Completeness**: Preserve 100% of current functionality during migration
2. **Generalization**: Support any generic dataset and autoencoder architecture
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensure identical visualizations between run and load operations
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code structure for future development
5. **Usability**: Simple, intuitive interface for complex experiments
6. **Version Control**: Establish robust Git workflow for all development activities

### 2.3 Success Metrics
- All current notebook functionality migrated without loss
- Four wrapper functions working correctly in new notebook interface
- All visualization consistency issues resolved
- Run and load operations produce identical visualizations
- Package handles any generic dataset and architecture

## 4. Functional Requirements

#### 4.1.1 Git Repository Setup
- Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore for Python projects
- Set up GitHub repository for remote backup and collaboration
- Establish main branch as stable, working code only
- Configure branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to main

#### 4.1.2 Branch Management Strategy
**Branch Naming Conventions**:
- `feature/migrate-data-module`: Data module migration
- `feature/migrate-models-module`: Models module migration
- `feature/migrate-experiment-module`: Experiment module migration
- `feature/migrate-visualization-module`: Visualization module migration
- `feature/create-wrapper-functions`: Four core wrapper functions

**Branch Lifecycle**:
- Create feature branch from latest main
- Develop and test functionality
- Commit working code with descriptive messages
- Push branch for backup
- Create pull request for code review
- Merge to main after approval
- Delete feature branch after successful merge

#### 4.1.3 Commit Guidelines
**Commit Frequency**:
- After each module migration is complete and tested
- After each bug fix is verified
- After each wrapper function is working correctly
- Before risky refactoring or major changes
- At end of each work session

**Commit Message Standards**:
- Use descriptive, action-oriented messages
- Include context about what was changed and why
- Examples:
  - "Migrate dataset generation functions from notebook to data module"
  - "Fix t-SNE seed consistency between run and load operations"
  - "Add training data to performance grid visualization"
  - "Create wrapper function for experiment execution"

### 4.2 Jupyter Notebook Development Requirements

#### 4.2.1 Critical Tool Usage
**⚠️ MANDATORY**: All Jupyter notebook operations MUST use `notebook_mcp` tools to prevent corruption:
- **NEVER use standard `edit_file` tool** on `.ipynb` files
- **ALWAYS use notebook_mcp tools** for reading, editing, and creating notebooks
- **Investigate notebook issues independently** using available MCP tools before asking for help

#### 4.2.2 Available notebook_mcp Tools
**File Operations**:
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_create`: Create new notebooks
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_delete`: Delete notebooks
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_rename`: Rename/move notebooks

**Reading and Analysis**:
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_read`: Read entire notebook structure
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_read_cell`: Read specific cell content
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_get_cell_count`: Get total cell count
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_get_info`: Get notebook information
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_read_metadata`: Read notebook metadata

**Cell Operations**:
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_add_cell`: Add new cells
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_edit_cell`: Edit cell content
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_delete_cell`: Delete cells

**Validation and Export**:
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_validate`: Validate notebook structure
- `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_export`: Export to other formats

#### 4.2.3 Development Workflow Integration
**Investigation Strategy**:
1. Use `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_get_info` to understand notebook structure
2. Use `mcp_notebook_mcp_notebook_read_cell` to examine specific cells
3. Use reading tools to understand context before making changes
4. Ask for clarification only if information cannot be determined from tools

**Content Guidelines**:
- Use `$ ... $` for inline math and `$$ ... $$` for display math
- Avoid unsupported cell magics (`%%bash`, `%%timeit`, `%%writefile`)
- Use `!command` for shell commands instead of `%%bash`
- Always validate notebooks after major changes

**Best Practices**:
- Use notebooks as **interfaces** to the `autoencoder_lib` package
- Keep **core logic in Python modules**, not notebook cells
- **Import and use package functions** rather than defining in notebooks
- Maintain **clean separation** between package code and notebook interface
