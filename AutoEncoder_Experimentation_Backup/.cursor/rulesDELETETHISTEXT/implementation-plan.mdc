# Implementation Plan

## Phase 0: Immediate Notebook Improvements

1. **Bug Fixes in Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Identify and fix any bugs in the existing `AutoEncoderJupyterTest.ipynb`
   - Test fixes to ensure stable execution of the current functionality
   - Document fixed bugs to prevent regression

2. **Notebook Reorganization and Wrapper Creation**:
   - Refactor code to create a unified Autoencoder Wrapper class
   - Implement flexible parameter handling for dataset paths, model directories, etc.
   - Create configuration options for easily switching between:
     - Different dataset directories
     - Various model architectures
     - Hyperparameter settings
     - Output/results directories
   - Ensure separation of concerns between data handling, model definition, training, and evaluation
   - Add documentation for the wrapper's usage

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Preparation
